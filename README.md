Introduction</br></br>

COVID-19</br>

Covid-19 is also termed as “Coronavirus(CoV).” It is a novel virus that was not identified in humans before 2020. Cov is the large family of SARS-Cov,  and it is seen to be transmitted from animals to humans. This virus causes illnesses such as common cold, respiratory problems, etc. The outbreak of this virus has resulted in a pandemic; it has affected 37.1 million people and has caused 1.07 Million fatalities worldwide till date.</br></br>

Why detection from Chest Radiography?</br>

To provide Immediate results.</br>
Currently, the Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT PCR) test is taking 2-3 hours for the results.</br>
Extend of spread can be detected from chest radiography.</br>
